Privacy Policy and Terms of Service for "Blyxly"
Effective Date: February 1, 2026
This document (hereinafter the "Policy") is a legally binding agreement between the Administration of the Blyxly Telegram Mini App (hereinafter the "Service", "App") and the individual using the Service (hereinafter the "User"). By accessing and using the Service, the User confirms their full and unconditional acceptance of these terms.
1. Status of the Service and Virtual Assets
1.1. Entertainment Simulation. The Service is a social gaming platform and market simulator. All assets within the App, including "tokens," "coins," "portfolio positions," and the "BLYX" currency, are strictly virtual in-app items (game points).
1.2. No Real-World Value. Virtual assets within the Service:
Are not cryptocurrencies, electronic money, or securities.
Have no equivalent monetary value in the real world.
Cannot be exchanged for fiat currency (USD, EUR, etc.) or any material values by the Administration.
1.3. Closed Ecosystem. The Service does not provide any technical means to withdraw virtual funds to external wallets, bank accounts, or third-party platforms. All trades and transfers are recorded only within the Service's internal database.
2. Token Creation, AI Moderation, and Reporting
2.1. Launching Tokens. The Service allows Users to launch virtual tokens for a simulated bonding curve. This action requires a non-refundable virtual fee of 200 BLYX.
2.2. User Responsibility. The User is solely responsible for all content (names, tickers, descriptions, and images) uploaded during the token creation process.
2.3. AI-Powered Verification. All user-generated content is subject to mandatory automated screening by Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms.
The AI may reject content that contains violence, pornography, hate speech, or obvious copyright infringement.
The User accepts the AI’s automated decisions as final.
2.4. Report System. The Service includes a "Report" functionality. The Administration reserves the right to review reported tokens and may delete content or block Users who violate community standards or third-party intellectual property (e.g., unauthorized use of trademarks) without prior notice.
3. P2P Market and External Trade Prohibition (RMT Ban)
3.1. Internal P2P Mechanics. Users may transfer BLYX and trade virtual tokens within the App interface. Each BLYX transfer is subject to a 5% virtual service fee, deducted automatically.
3.2. Ban on Real-Money Trading (RMT). It is strictly prohibited to buy, sell, or trade BLYX currency, tokens, or accounts for real-world money or assets on external platforms (e.g., third-party marketplaces, chat groups, or forums).
3.3. Disclaimer for Outside Agreements. The Administration is not liable for any agreements or scams occurring outside the official App interface. Users engaging in external trades do so at their own risk.
3.4. Sanctions. Any attempt to monetize game progress or assets outside the Service will result in a permanent ban and forfeiture of all virtual assets without the right to appeal.
4. Payments and Telegram Stars
4.1. Technical Gateway. The Service uses a Vercel-based backend as a technical bridge to generate payment invoices.
4.2. Payment Processing. All actual financial transactions, fund deductions, and security are handled exclusively by the Telegram platform. The Service does not receive or store credit card data or banking details.
4.3. No Refunds. All acquisitions of BLYX via Telegram Stars are final. Due to the nature of digital content provided instantly upon purchase, no refunds are permitted, even in the event of account termination for policy violations.
5. Unilateral Modifications and Waiver of Claims
5.1. Right to Amend. The Administration reserves the right to modify, update, or completely change any part of the Service, including game mechanics, tokenomics, bonding curve parameters, fees, and these Terms, at any time and at its sole discretion.
5.2. No Notification Obligation. The Administration is not required to provide individual or specific notice to Users regarding changes. Users are expected to review this document periodically.
5.3. Acceptance by Continued Use. Continued use of the Service following any changes constitutes the User’s full acceptance of the revised Terms and mechanics.
5.4. Waiver of Claims. The User waives any right to hold the Administration liable or seek compensation for changes in game rules, asset values, or modifications to the virtual economy.
