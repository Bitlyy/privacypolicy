Effective Date: January 31, 2026
This document (hereinafter the "Policy") governs the collection, processing, and protection of user data (hereinafter the "User") within the "Bitly" application (hereinafter the "Service", "App"), operating as a Telegram Mini App.
By using the Service, the User provides unconditional consent to this Policy and the terms stated herein.
1. Status of the Service and Virtual Assets
1.1. Entertainment Simulation. The Service is an entertainment market simulator. All mentions of "tokens," "coins," "stocks," and the "BLYX" currency within the Application refer exclusively to virtual in-app items.
1.2. No Real-World Value. Virtual assets within the Service:
Are not cryptocurrencies, electronic money, or securities.
Have no equivalent monetary value in the real world.
Cannot be exchanged for fiat currency (USD, EUR, etc.) or other material values by the Administration.
1.3. Closed Ecosystem. The Service does not provide any technical means to withdraw virtual funds to external wallets, bank accounts, or third-party platforms. Transfers and trades are strictly restricted to the internal Service environment.
2. Data Collection and Processing
We collect the minimum amount of data necessary to identify the User and save their game progress.

3. Payments and Telegram Stars
3.1. Payment Mechanism. The Service allows Users to acquire virtual items and top up balances using Telegram Stars.
3.2. Technical Role. Our technical infrastructure (including the Vercel-based backend) acts solely as a technical bridge (gateway) that processes internal requests and generates invoice requests for the Telegram platform.
3.3. Payment Processing. The actual payment processing, fund deduction, and transaction security are handled entirely by the Telegram platform. The Service does not receive, process, or store credit card data, bank details, or any other sensitive payment credentials.
3.4. No Refunds. Acquisitions of Telegram Stars and their subsequent exchange for in-app assets (BLYX) are final. Due to the nature of digital content provided instantly upon purchase, no refunds are permitted.
4. Limitation of Liability and External Agreements
4.1. No Buy-Back Policy. The Service Administration under no circumstances performs a "buy-back" of virtual currency or tokens from Users for real-world money.
4.2. Outside Agreements. The Service is intended for internal interaction only. The Administration is not responsible for any agreements, trades, or exchanges (including the sale of accounts or virtual currency) made by Users outside the official interface of the Application (e.g., via private messages, third-party groups, or external marketplaces).
4.3. User Risks. Any attempt by Users to monetize game progress or trade assets outside the Service is done at their own risk. We do not accept claims related to fraud, scams, or losses resulting from such third-party dealings.
5. User Content and Moderation
5.1. Responsibility. When creating tokens, the User agrees not to use images or text that violate copyrights, contain violence, pornography, or any illegal materials.
5.2. Enforcement. The Administration reserves the right to delete any content and block access to the Service for violating these rules without prior notice. Upon blocking, all virtual assets associated with the account are forfeited.
6. Disclaimer of Warranties
The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not guarantee error-free or uninterrupted operation of the Service. We are not liable for temporary loss of access, data loss, or failures caused by third-party providers (Vercel, Google, or the Telegram platform).

7.2. No Notification Obligation. The Administration is not required to provide individual or specific notice to Users regarding changes to this Policy. Users are expected to review this document periodically.
7.3. Acceptance. Continued use of the Service following any changes constitutes the User’s full acceptance of the revised Terms.
