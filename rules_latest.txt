3. Payments and Telegram Stars

The Administration is not responsible for any agreements, trades, or exchanges (including the sale of accounts or virtual currency) made by Users outside the official interface of the Application (e.g., via private messages, third-party groups, or external marketplaces).
4.3. User Risks. Any attempt by Users to monetize game progress outside the Service is done at their own risk. We do not accept claims related to fraud or losses resulting from such third-party dealings.
